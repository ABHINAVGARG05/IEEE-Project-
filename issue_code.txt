***The fact that the code is submitted in a text file is that the previous code I found online and tried to implement was detected as a Malware/Trojan threat by the Microsoft Defender System and had to spend various difficulties to remove it still some remnant of it is there in the system because of which compiler is not able to compile properly. I am constantly getting a prompt of permission denied by the compiler and then Microsoft Defender systems give the prompt that a threat has been found.
